# PECS-PRO

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

THIS DIRECTORY IS GENERATED CONTINUITY INFRASTRUCTURE.
DO NOT EDIT.
DO NOT PATCH.
DO NOT TREAT AS ENGINEERING SOURCECODE.

THIS FILE DOES NOT CONTAIN SOURCECODE.
IT ONLY CONTAINS:
- ENGINEERING TARGET LOCATIONS
- EXECUTION LOCALITY
- CONTINUITY RELATIONSHIPS
- RUNTIME TOPOLOGY

ENGINEERING TRUTH EXISTS ONLY IN:
WORKSPACE RUNTIME MODULES.

PECS artifacts are queryable continuity infrastructure only.
PECS is NOT editable engineering sourcecode.
Use `.pecs` for locality retrieval, then edit runtime workspace modules.

## Quick Install

Commands required to install PECS into a workspace:

```bash
# From PECS-PRO repository root
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e . --force-reinstall --no-deps

# Install and integrate into the target workspace
pecs install-workspace-assets "/Users/raj/Downloads/auto OCR app/"

# Open the workspace in VS Code and let the auto-start task launch the daemon
# Or manually verify and start the daemon
pecs status
pecs verify-workspace "/Users/raj/Downloads/auto OCR app/"
```

VS Code tasks:
- `PECS: Start Daemon`
- `PECS: Stop Daemon`
- `PECS: Refresh Continuity State`
- `PECS: Validate Continuity State`
- `PECS: Append Chat Event`

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer
- Install with `pip install -e .` from the PECS-PRO package root
- `watchdog` for live daemon monitoring

## What PECS-PRO v2 Does

PECS-PRO v2 is the continuity authority for workspace-local AI continuity.
It generates deterministically repeatable `.pecs/` artifacts that capture:
- runtime topology
- execution locality
- continuity relationships
- workspace target projections

PECS-PRO is not a reasoning engine.
It stabilizes the continuity state so an LLM can reason from compact, topology-aware evidence.

## What PECS-LITE Is

PECS-LITE is a stateless projection layer.
It does not scan the workspace, reconstruct topology, or infer authority independently.
Instead, it queries PECS-PRO continuity outputs and returns compact runtime workspace target projections.

PECS-LITE is intentionally:
- stateless
- lean
- query-driven
- projection-only

## E10 Process Flow

1. **Install workspace assets**
   - `pecs install-workspace-assets <workspace>` writes VS Code tasks, Continue rules, Copilot guidance, and `.pecs/` bridge assets.

2. **Start the workspace daemon**
   - The daemon runs in the workspace and populates `.pecs/` continuity artifacts from runtime workspace modules.

3. **Generate continuity infrastructure**
   - PECS-PRO writes `.pecs/active_context.json`, `.pecs/compact_bundle.json`, `.pecs/locality_index.json`, and other continuity artifacts.

4. **Use PECS-LITE as projection**
   - The model queries PECS-LITE, which reads PECS-PRO output and returns recommended runtime targets and execution neighborhood projections.

5. **Target runtime modules, not `.pecs`**
   - Workspace modules are authoritative. `.pecs` files are infrastructure only and must not be edited.

6. **Refresh and validate**
   - The daemon and bridge refresh `.pecs` when runtime state changes, and verification commands confirm installation health.

## Architecture Separation

Current implementation flow:

MODEL → PECS-LITE QUERY ADAPTER → PECS-PRO CONTINUITY AUTHORITY → `.pecs/` ARTIFACTS → MODEL

PECS keeps a strict separation between engine and workspace state:

- **PECS engine**: exporters, validators, normalization logic, topology tooling, bridge installers, and the continuity authority.
- **Workspace continuity state**: `.pecs/` artifacts, runtime evidence, bridge runtime/config, and installed VS Code/Continue guidance.

This separation keeps PECS deterministic, maintainable, and safe for AI-assisted workflows.

## PECS-PRO Authority Model (Final Architectural Realization)

**PECS-PRO is the ONLY continuity authority.**

PECS-PRO exclusively owns and maintains:
- runtime topology reconstruction
- execution graph continuity
- workspace structure scanning
- runtime activation evidence
- continuity state persistence
- topology-aware locality weighting
- ownership and mutation locality tracking
- runtime zone and cluster classification

PECS-PRO generates deterministic `.pecs/` artifacts:
- `.pecs/active_context.json` — runtime execution context
- `.pecs/active_topology.json` — current runtime topology
- `.pecs/locality_index.json` — locality-weighted targets
- `.pecs/compact_bundle.json` — compressed continuity state
- `.pecs/daemon_state.json` — daemon health and state

## PECS-LITE Projection Model (Query-Driven Stateless Layer)

**PECS-LITE is ONLY a stateless query and projection adapter.**

PECS-LITE exclusively does:
- normalize AI model queries
- request locality from PECS-PRO
- project compact runtime target neighborhoods
- compress continuity for model consumption
- adapt output format for specific AI tooling (Copilot, Continue)
- filter and shape authority-safe outputs

**PECS-LITE must NEVER:**
- run as an independent daemon
- maintain continuity state
- own topology artifacts
- reconstruct runtime relationships
- scan workspace
- infer execution state independently
- cache or index continuity data
- perform any form of authority reconstruction

PECS-LITE is invocation-driven only:
- queries PECS-PRO on demand
- returns ephemeral projection outputs
- stateless between invocations
- no persistent daemon responsibility

## Why This Authority Separation Matters

**Single Source of Truth:** Only PECS-PRO interprets runtime topology and continuity. This prevents drift where PECS-LITE makes different continuity inferences than PECS-PRO.

**Small, Predictable Projection:** PECS-LITE is small and stateless. It scales horizontally since it doesn't maintain state and doesn't conflict with other instances.

**Authority-Safe Model Guidance:** Models receive projection outputs labeled explicitly as ephemeral locality guidance, not canonical workspace truth. `.pecs/` artifacts are infrastructure only, never engineering sourcecode.

**Reduced Complexity:** All topology interpretation happens in PECS-PRO. PECS-LITE is a thin adapter layer, making failures easier to diagnose and security easier to audit.

## Context Bridge

The workspace-local context bridge exists only to:
- normalize continuity inputs deterministically
- compare before writing
- suppress no-op rewrites
- persist stable continuity anchors

The bridge does not:
- act as conversational authority
- perform semantic summarization
- orchestrate AI decisions
- replace LLM reasoning

## Supported AI Tooling

PECS is currently designed and tested primarily for:
- GitHub Copilot Chat
- Continue

Compatibility note:
- Other VS Code AI extensions may not preserve compatible continuity/workflow behavior.
- PECS is built around deterministic continuity anchors and sparse runtime projection, not broad semantic indexing.

## What changed in v2 vs v1

### v1
- line-number continuity anchors like `file.py:42`
- file-based locality tokens
- heavier continuity payloads
- no persistent live daemon

### v2
- canonical symbolic anchors like `PECS_ID:viewer.overlay.sync`
- compact anchor-based locality storage
- topology-aware retrieval via query adapters
- incremental live daemon generating `.pecs/` artifacts
- low-token compact context export
- no AST-heavy reconstruction or large continuity payloads

## Why PECS Exists: The Locality Problem

AI-assisted development creates **locality uncertainty** and **continuity drift**:

1. **Execution-Local Fragmentation**
   - Code changes scatter across files, modules, and runtime zones
   - An AI model loses track of which files are execution-adjacent vs. semantic-similar
   - Models treat all "similar" code equally, but runtime locality matters more

2. **Wrapper Penetration ("Gunpowder in Another Barrel")**
   - A bug exists in file A, but the ownership chain passes through wrappers in B and C
   - Fixing in A alone is incomplete; B or C needs changes too
   - An LLM may fix A but miss B/C because it doesn't see the wrapper dependency chain

3. **Mutation Ownership Drift**
   - A change in file A mutates runtime state that file D doesn't export
   - File D's code becomes stale relative to the mutation in A
   - The AI model doesn't know which files are mutation-dependent on which others

4. **Runtime Authenticity Loss**
   - After many edits, the workspace's actual runtime behavior diverges from inferred structure
   - No persistent record of which files currently run, which are dead code, which are active
   - Models reconstruct runtime state from scratch on each session, losing continuity

**PECS stabilizes execution locality continuity.** It does NOT replace reasoning or inference. The LLM still decides what to change. PECS just makes locality reliable.

## Known Limitations

PECS remains probabilistic and incomplete:
- **Runtime certainty:** PECS weights locality evidence but cannot guarantee wrapper penetration is complete
- **Mutation tracking:** Mutation ownership is inferred, not fully traced; some mutation chains may be incomplete
- **Semantic extraction:** Issue extraction from chat history is imperfect; some context gets lost
- **Continuity drift:** After many edits, some stale continuity may accumulate
- **Wrapper penetration:** Not all wrapper chains are detected; some ownership chains remain hidden

PECS reduces execution-locality uncertainty by orders of magnitude, but does not guarantee complete certainty.

## What PECS Does NOT Do

- Solve general LLM reasoning problems
- Eliminate ambiguity in code semantics
- Replace careful code review
- Guarantee correctness of changes
- Eliminate the need for testing
- Solve authentication, security, or permission issues
- Provide global semantic indexing
- Build a "reasoning engine" for the LLM

PECS is **locality stabilization infrastructure only.**

## Installation

### One-Command Setup (Recommended)

PECS-PRO is designed to be installed and configured with a single command per workspace.

#### Step 1: Install PECS-PRO CLI (One Time)

Clone or download PECS-PRO, then install it in editable mode:

```bash
# From PECS-PRO directory
cd /path/to/PECS_PRO_V2_FINAL/pecs_pro
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e . --force-reinstall --no-deps
```

Or set up a global alias (optional, for convenience):

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
alias pecs='/path/to/PECS_PRO_V2_FINAL/pecs_pro/.venv/bin/pecs'
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Step 2: Deploy PECS to Your Workspace (One Command)

Run this single command to set up any workspace:

```bash
pecs install-workspace-assets "/path/to/your/workspace"
```

That's it! This installs:

- **Copilot Configuration** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
  - Enforces PECS-first routing for context retrieval
  - Directs Copilot to check `.pecs/` artifacts before repository search

- **Continue Configuration** (`.continue/config.yaml` and `.continue/rules/pecs-first-routing.yaml`)
  - Registers PECS-first routing rule
  - Narrows search scope to locality-aware context

- **Workspace Documentation** (`.pecs/README.md`, `.pecs/README_WORKSPACE_PREPARATION.md`)
  - Bootstrap checkpoint confirming successful installation
  - Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guide

- **PECS Artifacts** (`.pecs/` directory structure)
  - Continuity snapshots
  - Active context tracking
  - Topology artifacts

#### Verify Installation

```bash
pecs verify-workspace "/path/to/your/workspace"
```

Expected output:

```
Verification: PASSED
✓ .pecs/WORKSPACE_BOOTSTRAP.md
✓ .pecs/README.md
✓ .github/copilot-instructions.md
✓ .continue/rules/pecs-first-routing.yaml
... (and more)
```

### Upgrade an Existing Workspace

To update PECS assets while preserving your configurations:

```bash
pecs install-workspace-assets "/path/to/your/workspace" --upgrade
```

### Repair a Broken Installation

If assets are missing or configuration is broken:

```bash
pecs repair-workspace "/path/to/your/workspace"
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Check Daemon Status

```bash
pecs status "/path/to/your/workspace"
```

#### Full Diagnostics

```bash
pecs doctor "/path/to/your/workspace" --verbose
```

#### Available Commands

```bash
pecs --help
```

Commands:

- `install-workspace-assets` — Deploy PECS to a workspace
- `verify-workspace` — Verify installation
- `repair-workspace` — Repair broken installations
- `status` — Check daemon status
- `doctor` — Diagnose environment and installation
- `PECS: Manual Update Chat History`

The installed task commands automatically run the workspace environment setup when present:

```bash
cd "${workspaceFolder}"
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Bridge/runtime artifacts are installed minimally under:

```text
.pecs/
	continuity/
	runtime/
	config/
	bridge/
```

## Minimal Invocation Flow

You can run PECS as a minimal deterministic flow:

```bash
pecs-pro init /path/to/your/workspace
pecs-pro refresh /path/to/your/workspace
pecs-pro validate /path/to/your/workspace
```

Equivalent workspace-local bridge invocation:

```bash
python3 .pecs/bridge/run_bridge.py refresh --workspace /path/to/your/workspace
python3 .pecs/bridge/run_bridge.py validate --workspace /path/to/your/workspace
```

PECS favors deterministic continuity stabilization over conversational memory systems.
The bridge remains intentionally lightweight and non-semantic.

## VS Code Task Workflow

After initialization, PECS tasks become available in VS Code.

Workflow:

- VSCode
- Terminal
- Run Task
- select a PECS task

Expected PECS task names:

- `PECS: Start Daemon`
- `PECS: Stop Daemon`
- `PECS: Refresh Continuity State`
- `PECS: Validate Continuity State`
- `PECS: Append Chat Event`
- `PECS: Manual Update Chat History`
- `PECS: Auto Start Daemon On Folder Open` (optional)

## Daemon Lifecycle (Intentional Manual Control)

The PECS daemon does NOT automatically start from package installation.
The user manually starts the daemon during active AI-assisted development sessions.
This is intentional to preserve deterministic and lightweight runtime behavior.

## Bridge Lifecycle

Normal users do NOT need to run the context bridge script directly.
Use standard PECS refresh flow (`pecs-pro refresh` or `PECS: Refresh Continuity State`).
Daemon/refresh operational flow is the supported path.
Bridge execution is handled automatically by the daemon/refresh flow.

The bridge remains:

- lightweight
- deterministic
- non-semantic

## No-Op Silence (Expected Behavior)

After stabilization, PECS intentionally becomes mostly silent.

No-op cycles are expected to produce:

- no rewrites
- no log spam
- no continuity churn

This is intentional and indicates deterministic steady-state behavior.

## New AI Session Workflow

For a new AI session, provide:

- current task/problem
- `.pecs` continuity state

Prefer this over large historical chat dumps.

PECS exists to reduce:

- continuity collapse
- search entropy
- edit locality ambiguity

Chat-history replay is optional and experimental.
Deterministic `.pecs` continuity state should be the primary handoff.

---

For manual setup procedures, see `README_MANUAL_SETUP.md`.
For optional chat-history workflows, see `README_AI_CHAT_HISTORY.md`.

## Running the daemon

To start the live continuity daemon for a workspace (from anywhere):

```bash
pecs-pro-daemon /path/to/your/workspace
```

Or, if running directly from source (not recommended for production):

```bash
python3 /path/to/PECS_PRO_V2_FINAL/pecs_pro/run_pecs_daemon.py /path/to/your/workspace
```

The daemon creates and updates a disposable `.pecs/` directory inside the monitored workspace.

## Notes

- Installing the package does not automatically start the daemon.
- The daemon must be running for `.pecs/` artifacts to be generated.
- `.pecs/` is cache-only and disposable.
- Do not edit `.pecs/` manually.

## Recommended workflow

1. Install PECS-PRO in editable mode.
2. Start the daemon before editing the target workspace.
3. Make sure `.pecs/` is present and being updated.
4. Periodically export continuity state from `.pecs/` into compact continuity snapshots.
5. Consume `.pecs/` JSON exports from tooling or integrations.

New projects benefit from early continuity initialization so topology anchors and continuity snapshots exist before sessions become fragmented.

## PECS-LITE Design Principle: Projection Discipline

PECS-LITE exists for ONE purpose:

**Reduce execution-locality entropy for constrained coding models.**

PECS-LITE intentionally sacrifices:
- continuity completeness
- topology breadth
- historical context

In favor of:
- small-model execution locality precision
- bounded runtime target neighborhoods
- high-confidence locality narrowing

### Why Projection Discipline Matters

Large continuity dumps fail for small-context models because:

1. **Search entropy explosion** — thousands of candidate files overwhelm model reasoning
2. **Token budget exhaustion** — complete topology metadata consumes model context
3. **Noise amplification** — historical and stale locality distract from current execution
4. **Authority confusion** — models struggle to distinguish infrastructure from sourcecode

PECS-LITE solves this by:

- **Hard-limiting projection breadth** — small models receive 3-6 primary targets + 2-4 neighbors only
- **Confidence-ordering targets** — highest-confidence runtime files first
- **Entropy reduction** — aggressive filtering of distant, inactive, historical locality
- **Authority clarity** — explicit separation of editable modules from `.pecs` infrastructure

### Projection Profiles

PECS-LITE supports three projection profiles:

#### SMALL Profile (6k–32k models)
- 3 primary runtime targets
- 2 secondary neighbors
- 2000-token budget
- Highest confidence only
- Used for Qwen, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet with other context

#### MEDIUM Profile (32k–100k models)
- 6 primary targets
- 4 secondary neighbors
- 4000-token budget
- Near-locality adjacency
- Balanced breadth and precision

#### LARGE Profile (100k+ models)
- 10 primary targets
- 6 secondary neighbors
- 8000-token budget
- Broader but still strictly bounded

All profiles enforce:
- Hard target count limits
- Token budgeting
- Safe `.pecs` artifact exclusion
- Small-model safety validation

### PECS-LITE Query Flow Integrity

PECS-LITE maintains authority separation by:

1. **Querying PECS-PRO exclusively** — never scans workspace
2. **Reading .pecs artifacts only** — never owns continuity state
3. **Returning projections, not topology** — ephemeral guidance only
4. **Recording query diagnostics** — proving no reconstruction occurred
5. **Validating small-model safety** — ensuring no .pecs exposure to models

Every projection includes:
- Query flow diagnostics
- Health metrics
- Authority confirmations
- Safety validation results

Negative assertions prove:
- "PECS-LITE did NOT scan workspace"
- "PECS-LITE did NOT reconstruct topology"
- "PECS-LITE did NOT own continuity state"

### Why Projections are NOT Editable

PECS-LITE projections are:
- **Ephemeral** — regenerated on each query
- **Lossy** — intentionally simplified for models
- **Infrastructure** — guidance only, not sourcecode
- **Stateless** — no persistence or authority

Models must:
- Use projected targets to locate **editable runtime files**
- Never edit `.pecs` artifacts
- Never treat projections as authoritative sourcecode
- Query PECS-LITE, never edit its outputs

### Performance Characteristics

Small-model projection hardening achieves:
- **3-10x token reduction** — compared to raw continuity dumps
- **50-70% entropy reduction** — compared to workspace-wide file lists
- **100-200ms query latency** — sub-second projection generation
- **Zero workspace scanning** — file I/O bounded to `.pecs/` directory only

## Engineering Continuity Principle

PECS preserves accepted engineering continuity.

PECS does NOT preserve raw conversational history as projection context.

### Why Raw Chat is Noisy

Raw transcript history often contains:
- failed edits
- rollback pollution
- duplicate exploratory reasoning
- stale locality assumptions
- wrapper confusion

Even large models can degrade when fed noisy conversational continuity.

### What PECS Preserves Instead

PECS continuity is structured and compact:
- issue -> accepted locality -> outcome chains
- rejected locality chains for downranking
- continuity confidence (probabilistic, not deterministic)
- accepted followup continuity and locality stability
- unresolved engineering locality tensions (bounded)

### Why Accepted and Rejected Locality Both Matter

- Accepted locality captures stable engineering ownership and successful followups.
- Rejected locality prevents repeated mutation of failed areas.
- Confidence scoring prevents false certainty when continuity is weak.

### Profile-Aware Engineering Continuity Richness

#### SMALL profile
- tiny accepted continuity anchors only
- accepted locality + continuity confidence
- at most one rejected locality hint
- no narrative continuity

#### MEDIUM profile
- bounded continuity chains
- nearby engineering continuity relationships
- confidence-aware locality ambiguity

#### LARGE profile
- richer but bounded accepted engineering continuity
- accepted locality evolution
- rejected locality chains
- unresolved engineering tensions
- mutation-locality ambiguity

All profiles remain structured, bounded, and execution-local.
PECS never emits raw chat dumps as continuity payload.

### Why This Helps Small and Large Models

- Small models avoid search entropy collapse by inheriting compact accepted continuity anchors.
- Large models gain higher-signal continuity linkage without continuity sludge.
- Both receive probabilistic locality guidance with explicit confidence and ambiguity.

It is a continuity infrastructure layer only.
Use it to support human-directed workflows, not to replace them.

PECS-LITE is a stateless projection layer.
It does not reason, infer, or own continuity authority.
It queries PECS-PRO and returns bounded locality guidance.
Never edit PECS-LITE outputs or treat them as sourcecode.
