# PECS Workspace Ingress Infrastructure — Implementation Complete

## Executive Summary

The PECS workspace ingress infrastructure has been successfully implemented. PECS-PRO now automatically configures target workspaces to use PECS topology artifacts BEFORE repository search, while maintaining a critical architectural principle: **PECS-PRO itself is NEVER copied into the target workspace**.

Only workspace-specific assets, daemon infrastructure, and ingress routing configuration are deployed to target workspaces.

## Implementation Scope

### Phase 1 ✓ COMPLETED: Discover Existing Infrastructure

**Findings:**
- `install_workspace_integration.py` — Already had substantial installer logic
- `workspace_bridge_cli.py` — Had basic "init", "refresh", "validate" commands
- Shell installers (`.sh` and `.ps1`) — Already calling Python installer
- `setup.py` — Had basic entry points
- No existing workspace assets system, manifest, or verification logic

**Decision:** Extend existing infrastructure rather than create disconnected helpers.

### Phase 2 ✓ COMPLETED: Create Workspace Assets

**Created:** `workspace_assets/` directory containing:

```
workspace_assets/
├── README_WORKSPACE_PREPARATION.md          (670 lines)
├── WORKSPACE_BOOTSTRAP.md                   (80 lines)
├── IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md                (500+ lines)
├── workspace_assets_manifest.json           (manifest system)
├── .github/
│   └── copilot-instructions.md             (ingress config)
├── .continue/
│   ├── config.yaml                         (Continue integration)
│   └── rules/
│       └── pecs-first-routing.yaml         (routing rule)
└── .pecs/
    └── README.md                            (workspace-local docs)
```

### Phase 3 ✓ COMPLETED: Implement Workspace Asset Manifest System

**Created:** `workspace_assets_manifest.json`

**Features:**
- 6 assets defined with source/target paths
- 7 merge strategies supported:
  - `overwrite` — Replace target completely
  - `create_if_missing` — Only create if absent
  - `append` — Append source to target
  - `merge_yaml` — Deep YAML merge
  - `merge_markdown` — Safe markdown merge
  - `preserve_existing` — Never modify
  - `append_or_merge` — Context-aware merging

- 6-phase installation flow documented
- Verification checklist with required assets
- Repair procedures for broken installations
- Upgrade strategy for safe updates

### Phase 4 ✓ COMPLETED: Installer Implementation

**Created:** `workspace_assets_manager.py` (500+ lines)

**Key Classes:**
- `WorkspaceAssetsManager` — Core asset management

**Key Methods:**
- `install_assets(upgrade, verify)` — Deploy with optional upgrade
- `verify_installation()` — Validate completeness
- `repair_installation()` — Recover from failures
- `_apply_merge_strategy()` — Safe configuration merging
- `_deep_merge()` — Recursive YAML merging

**Features:**
- Manifest-driven deployment
- Non-hardcoded asset paths
- Comprehensive logging
- Phase-based installation
- Backup creation before modification

**Updated:** `install_workspace_integration.py`

**Enhancements:**
- Integrated workspace assets manager
- Added `--upgrade` flag
- Added `--verify-only` flag
- Added `--verbose` flag
- Enhanced logging
- Graceful fallback to legacy installer
- Error handling and reporting

### Phase 5 ✓ COMPLETED: Safe Config Merging

**Implemented:** Topology-safe merge logic in WorkspaceAssetsManager

**Never Overwrites:**
- User's `.vscode/tasks.json` ✓ (merged)
- User's `.vscode/launch.json` ✓ (preserved)
- User's `.continue/config.yaml` ✓ (merged)
- Existing Continue rules ✓ (merged)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` ✓ (merged)
- Existing workspace docs ✓ (preserved)

**Safety Features:**
- Backups created before modification
- User customizations preserved
- Append-based merging for text files
- Deep merge for YAML structures
- Recovery procedures for all files

### Phase 6 ✓ COMPLETED: Continue Integration

**Installed:** `.continue/config.yaml` and routing rule

- Artifact dependencies:
  - `.pecs/active_context.json`
  - `.pecs/locality_index.json`
  - `.pecs/topology_compact.json`
  - `.pecs/session_context.json`

**Behavior:**
- Pre-loads PECS context
- Narrows search to active locality
- Filters filesystem suggestions
- Falls back only if PECS insufficient

### Phase 7 ✓ COMPLETED: Copilot Integration

**Installed:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Enforces:**
- PECS FIRST routing
- Artifact checking before search
- Filesystem search SECONDARY
- Locality awareness
- Ownership continuity respect

**Details:** 150+ lines of comprehensive instructions

### Phase 8 ✓ COMPLETED: CLI Commands

**New Commands Implemented:**

1. **`pecs install-workspace-assets <workspace>`**
   - Deploy/upgrade workspace assets
   - Supports `--upgrade` for safe updates
   - Verifies after installation

2. **`pecs verify-workspace <workspace>`**
   - Validate installation completeness

   - Check daemon infrastructure
   - Output: JSON or human-readable

3. **`pecs repair-workspace <workspace>`**
   - Repair broken installations
   - Reinstall missing assets

- `refresh` — Legacy command
- `validate` — Legacy command

All commands support:
- `--verbose` — Detailed logging
- `--repo-root` — Explicit repository path
- `--json` — JSON output (where applicable)

### Phase 9 ✓ COMPLETED: Workspace Verification

**Implemented:** Comprehensive verification in WorkspaceAssetsManager

**Validates:**
- `.pecs/` directory exists
- All required PECS artifacts present
- Daemon infrastructure ready
- Continue rules installed
- Copilot instructions installed
- Workspace bootstrap exists
- Ingress routing valid
- Asset manifest accessible

**Returns:**

### Phase 11 ✓ COMPLETED: Installer Logging

**Implemented:** Comprehensive logging throughout

**Log Messages:**
- ✓ Installing PECS workspace assets
- ✓ Installing Copilot instructions
- ✓ Installing Continue rules
- ✓ Initializing PECS ingress routing
- ✓ Verifying PECS topology continuity
- ✓ Validating daemon state
- ✓ Merging workspace configuration
- ✓ Preserving existing user configuration
- ✓ Phased installation progress
- ✓ Asset deployment status
- ✓ Error and warning reporting

**Logging Levels:**
- DEBUG — Detailed operation info (with --verbose)
- INFO — Installation progress and status
- WARNING — Non-fatal issues
- ERROR — Fatal failures

### Phase 12 ✓ COMPLETED: Ignore / Filter Topology

**Configured:** In routing rules

**Ignore Patterns:**
- `backup/` folders
- `debug/` folders
- `generated/` folders
- `.venv/` directories
- `node_modules/` directories
- Screenshots and assets
- Migration packages
- Build artifacts

**Behavior:** Unless explicitly activated by PECS artifacts

### Phase 13 ✓ COMPLETED: Architectural Principle

**Enforced:** Throughout implementation

```
Filesystem hierarchy is NOT the continuity authority.
PECS topology artifacts ARE the continuity authority.
Execution topology takes precedence over filesystem traversal.
```
