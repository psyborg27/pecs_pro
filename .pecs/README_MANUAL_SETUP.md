# PECS Manual Setup Guide

This guide is for users who want to install PECS into a workspace without using the auto-installer script.

## Persistent Infrastructure Notice

PECS is now persistent developer infrastructure. Do **NOT** install or run PECS from transient or unstable directories such as:
- Downloads
- Desktop
- /tmp or other temporary folders
- Removable/external drives

**Recommended install locations:**
- `~/Developer/PECS/`
- `~/Applications/PECS/`

PECS must reside in a stable, user-owned directory to ensure reliable operation and avoid accidental deletion or corruption. This is critical for continuity and daemon reliability.


## Dependency Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer
- `watchdog` Python package (required for daemon monitoring)
- `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` for install bootstrap

## Installation Health Check

After manual setup, verify PECS installation and entrypoints:

```bash
# From the PECS repo root
pecs doctor
```

Or run the bootstrap health check directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/pecs_health_check.py
```

To validate dependencies only:

```bash
python3 install_workspace_integration.py <workspace-root> --validate-deps
```

## Status

PECS is transitioning from experimental to persistent infrastructure. Validate all outputs manually. Use backups, version control, and human supervision. PECS does not replace engineering judgment.

## Supported AI tooling

PECS is currently designed and tested primarily for:

- GitHub Copilot Chat
- Continue

Other VS Code AI extensions may not preserve compatible continuity/workflow behavior.
PECS does not claim universal compatibility.

## What to copy into the workspace

Copy these files from the PECS package folder into the target workspace:

- `.continue/rules/PECS_CONTEXT_RULE.md`
- `.continue/rules/PECS_APPEND_RULE.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.pecs/tools/append_ai_chat_history.py`
- `.pecs/tools/update_ai_chat_history.sh`
- `.pecs/README_WORKSPACE_INTEGRATION.md`

**Important:** `.pecs` artifacts are generated continuity infrastructure only. Do not edit `.pecs` files as if they were engineering sourcecode. Use them only to locate runtime workspace targets and verify locality.

Create these files if they do not already exist:

- `.pecs/ai_chat_history.json` with an initial value of `[]` (optional)
- `.vscode/tasks.json`
- `.vscode/settings.json`

## Environment setup commands

Clone the PECS repository into a stable install location before initializing a workspace.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/Developer/pecs_pro
cd ~/Developer/pecs_pro
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
```

Then confirm the install:

```bash
pecs doctor
```

If you want to install from a local source checkout only for the PECS package, use:

```bash
python -m pip install -e /path/to/PECS
```

## Rebinding a Workspace After Relocation

If PECS moves to a new install root, rerun the package bootstrap and then refresh workspace bindings:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/Developer/pecs_pro
cd ~/Developer/pecs_pro
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
pecs rebind-workspace "/path/to/your/workspace" --upgrade
```

This updates all workspace integration files and replaces stale PECS path references.

## Configure VS Code

The auto-installer normally writes these for you, but manually you should ensure:

- `.vscode/tasks.json` contains PECS start/stop/chat append tasks
- `.vscode/tasks.json` contains `PECS: Manual Update Chat History`
- `.vscode/settings.json` includes `pecs.contextPath` pointing to `.pecs/active_context.json`
- Workspace settings are saved in the target workspace, not in the PECS package folder

After setup, open tasks using:

- VSCode
- Terminal
- Run Task
- select a PECS task

Expected task names include:

- `PECS: Start Daemon`
- `PECS: Stop Daemon`
- `PECS: Refresh Continuity State`
- `PECS: Validate Continuity State`

## Configure Continue

Continue reads rules from `.continue/rules/`.
Make sure these are present:

- `.continue/rules/PECS_CONTEXT_RULE.md`
- `.continue/rules/PECS_APPEND_RULE.md`
- Keep `.continue/rules/CONTINUITY_MAP.md` in the workspace if you already use it

## Configure Copilot

Copilot reads workspace instructions from:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Keep the instructions focused on reading `.pecs` artifacts before edits.

## Start the daemon

After installation and workspace setup, start the daemon:

```bash
pecs-pro-daemon "/path/to/your/workspace"
```

If you are starting from the source checkout directly:

```bash
cd /path/to/PECS
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m run_pecs_daemon "/path/to/your/workspace"
```

The daemon is intentionally manual-start during active AI-assisted development sessions.
It does not auto-start from package installation.
After stabilization, no-op cycles are intentionally mostly silent
(no rewrites, no log spam, no continuity churn).

## Bridge lifecycle

Users normally do not run bridge scripts directly.
Use standard refresh flow (`pecs-pro refresh` or `PECS: Refresh Continuity State`).
The bridge remains lightweight, deterministic, and non-semantic.

## New AI session handoff

For a new AI session, provide:

- current task/problem
- `.pecs` continuity state

Prefer this over large historical chat dumps.
Chat-history replay is optional and experimental.

## What automatic installation does

If you use `pecs-pro-install-workspace`, it installs all of the above for you and also creates the PECS tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`.
